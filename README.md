## üöÄ Getting Started

### Live Demo
Visit: `https://benlaken.github.io/webxr_arcade/`

### Local Development
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/benlaken/webxr_arcade.git
   cd webxr_arcade
   ```

2. Serve locally (required for WebXR):
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .
   ```

3. Access at `http://localhost:8000` or your local server URL

### VR Setup
1. Put on your Meta Quest 3 headset
2. Open the browser
3. Navigate to the live demo URL
4. Click "Enter VR" when prompted
5. Enjoy the retro arcade experience!

## üéØ Controls

### Hand Gestures
- **Pinch**: Grab boids or fountain voxels (thumb and index finger close)
- **Fist**: Create punch force blasts (2 of 3 fingers curled, with fast movement)
- **Point**: Hold for 3 seconds to teleport (index extended, others curled)
- **Shake**: Transform held voxels into predators (vigorous hand movement while holding)

### Desktop Fallback
- **Mouse**: Look around
- **Click**: Basic interaction (limited functionality)

## üé® Visual Style

The experience embraces clean, performance-focused aesthetics:
- **Wireframe Geometry**: Classic vector graphics style
- **Neon Colors**: Cyan, orange, and green glowing elements
- **Particle Effects**: Explosion and trail systems
- **Minimalist Design**: Focused on core interactive elements
- **Dark Environment**: Space-like atmosphere with selective lighting

## üÜï Recent Improvements

### Hand Tracking Reliability  
- **Startup stabilization**: 60-frame grace period prevents false punch detection on app load
- **Velocity smoothing**: Lerp-based position smoothing handles tracking loss gracefully
- **Improved fist detection**: 2-of-3 finger algorithm with optimized thresholds
- **Player rig system**: Proper VR coordinate handling for teleportation

### Performance & Visibility
- **Space battle optimization**: 30% speed reduction for asteroids and spaceships
- **Debug overlay expansion**: Larger debug panel (800x600) fits all information
- **Enhanced logging**: Comprehensive console output for troubleshooting

### Bug Fixes
- **Punch detection**: Eliminated startup auto-activation and cooldown conflicts
